In this project, I built a recommendation engine that suggests the most relevant jobs to candidates based on their skills.

ðŸ”¹ What I did:

Collected and analyzed job descriptions and skill sets

Used TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to match user-provided skills with job requirements

Designed a ranking system to recommend the top N relevant jobs

Implemented in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) with a clean workflow in Jupyter Notebook

âœ¨ This project helped me strengthen my skills in NLP, Recommendation Systems, and Data Science.

Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback and suggestions! ðŸ’¬
